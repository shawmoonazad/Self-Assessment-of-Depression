### Idea
The research focuses on using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to assess depression among Bangladeshi university students. It investigates how various social factors, such as academic satisfaction, relationship dynamics, parental pressure, and exposure to violence, contribute to depression. The study employs multiple machine learning models and depression assessment scales to identify the most effective methods for diagnosing depression. Additionally, it explores the use of explainable AI to ensure model transparency and provide personalized feedback for self-assessment.

### Dataset

* The dataset was obtained from a study conducted to identify depression among Bangladeshi university students.
